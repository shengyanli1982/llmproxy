    -   _Content Type_: text/plain

## Use Cases

LLMProxy is strategically designed for the following enterprise applications:

-   **Enterprise AI Integration**: Centrally manage LLM provider access, implement robust security policies, and optimize cost efficiency
-   **AI Application Development**: Dramatically simplify integration with multiple LLM providers while improving system reliability and fault tolerance
-   **Multi-cloud Strategy**: Deploy as a sidecar or standalone service to provide a unified LLM API access layer across diverse cloud environments and on-premises infrastructure

## Response Time Aware Load Balancing Algorithm

LLMProxy's response time aware load balancing algorithm is an advanced intelligent scheduling strategy engineered specifically for high-latency, compute-intensive services like Large Language Models. Unlike traditional algorithms, this approach continuously monitors real-time performance metrics of upstream services and dynamically routes traffic to optimal service nodes.

### How It Works

1. **Real-time Performance Monitoring**: The system continuously collects and analyzes key performance indicators for each upstream node:

    - **Average Response Time**: Historical response times processed using exponential moving average (EMA) smoothing for stability
    - **Current Load**: Real-time count of concurrent in-flight requests being processed
    - **Success Rate**: Statistical percentage of successfully completed requests

2. **Comprehensive Performance Scoring**: A holistic performance score is calculated for each node using the following formula, where lower scores indicate better performance:

    $$\text{Score} = \text{ResponseTime} \times (\text{ProcessingRequests} + 1) \times \frac{1}{\text{SuccessRate}}$$

    Where:

    - $\text{ResponseTime}$ represents the node's average response time in milliseconds
    - $\text{ProcessingRequests}$ represents the number of currently in-flight requests
    - $\text{SuccessRate}$ represents the node's request success rate (0.0-1.0)

![score](./images/response_aware_parameter_impact_en.png)

3. **Intelligent Node Selection**:

    - Starting from the current polling position, the algorithm evaluates all healthy upstream nodes
    - It calculates the comprehensive performance score for each available node
    - The node with the lowest score (indicating optimal performance) is selected for the current request
    - The system increments the processing request count for the selected node

4. **Continuous Adaptive Optimization**:
    - After request completion, the system records the actual response time
    - The node's average response time is updated using a configurable smoothing factor (default: 0.15)
    - The processing request count is decremented
    - Success rate statistics are updated based on the request outcome

### Advantages

-   **Dynamic Adaptation**: Automatically responds to performance fluctuations without manual intervention
-   **Multi-dimensional Analysis**: Considers both latency and concurrent load, preventing any single node from becoming overloaded
-   **Statistical Stability**: Employs exponential moving averages to smooth transient fluctuations for consistent traffic distribution
-   **High-Performance Design**: Utilizes lock-free architecture and atomic operations for efficient operation in high-concurrency environments
-   **Integrated Fault Management**: Seamlessly works with circuit breaker mechanisms to bypass unhealthy nodes

### Optimal Use Cases

This algorithm delivers exceptional value in these scenarios:

-   **LLM API Proxying**: Managing requests with latencies ranging from hundreds of milliseconds to tens of seconds
-   **Heterogeneous Infrastructure**: Environments with varying server capabilities, capacities, or network conditions
-   **Dynamic Workloads**: Applications with significant load variations throughout operational cycles
-   **Mission-Critical Systems**: Enterprise deployments with stringent SLA requirements for response time and availability

### Configuration Example

```yaml
upstream_groups:
    - name: "llm_services"
      upstreams:
          # Note: Response time aware strategy does not utilize weight values
          - name: "openai_service"
          - name: "anthropic_service"
      balance:
          strategy: "response_aware" # Enable response time aware load balancing
```

## Circuit Breaker Mechanism

LLMProxy integrates a sophisticated Circuit Breaker pattern to enhance system resilience and operational stability. This mechanism automatically detects failing upstream services, rapidly "trips" connections to avoid resource depletion and request backlogs, and intelligently reconnects when services recover.

### How It Works

The circuit breaker implements a three-state lifecycle model:

1. **Closed State (Normal Operation)**:

    - Default operational state where all requests are forwarded to upstream services
    - Continuously monitors request success/failure patterns against configurable thresholds
    - Transitions to Open state when the failure rate exceeds the defined threshold (e.g., 50%)

2. **Open State (Protection Mode)**:

    - Circuit breaker activates, immediately rejecting requests without attempting to forward to the failing upstream
    - Implements fast-fail responses, eliminating wait times and conserving system resources
    - Automatically transitions to Half-Open state after a configurable cooldown period (e.g., 30 seconds)

3. **Half-Open State (Recovery Assessment)**:
    - Allows a limited number of test requests to evaluate if the upstream service has recovered
    - Upon successful test requests, transitions back to Closed state, resuming normal operations
    - If test requests continue to fail, reverts to Open state, maintaining protection mechanisms

### Intelligent Failover

The circuit breaker integrates seamlessly with the load balancer to provide sophisticated failover capabilities:

-   When an upstream service trips, traffic is automatically redistributed to healthy services within the same group
-   Error responses are returned to clients only when all upstream services in a group become unavailable
-   Circuit breaker state information is transparently incorporated into load balancing decisions, ensuring optimal routing

### Key Benefits

-   **Rapid Failure Detection**: Identifies unavailable services immediately, eliminating timeout-related delays
-   **Resource Conservation**: Prevents requests to known failing services from consuming critical system resources
-   **Failure Isolation**: Contains service failures, preventing them from cascading throughout the system
-   **Automatic Recovery**: Detects service restoration and seamlessly reintegrates recovered services
-   **Configurable Behavior**: Offers granular configuration options for each upstream service
-   **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Provides detailed metrics on circuit breaker states and transitions

### Configuration Example

```yaml
upstreams:
    - name: "openai_service"
      url: "https://api.openai.com/v1"
      breaker:
          threshold: 0.5 # Failure rate threshold triggering circuit breaking (50%)
          cooldown: 30 # Recovery assessment delay in seconds (1-3600, default: 30)

    - name: "anthropic_service"
      url: "https://api.anthropic.com"
      breaker:
          threshold: 0.3 # Lower threshold for critical services (30%)
          cooldown: 60 # Extended cooldown for services with longer recovery patterns
```

          token: "YOUR_API_KEY"
      headers:
          - op: "insert"
            key: "x-api-key" # Provider-specific header requirements
            value: "YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Upstream Group Configuration

```yaml
upstream_groups:
    - name: "mixgroup" # [Required] Unique group identifier
      upstreams: # [Required] List of upstream service references
          - name: "openai_primary" # Must match a defined upstream service name
            weight: 8 # [Optional] Used only in weighted_roundrobin strategy
          - name: "anthropic_primary"
            weight: 2 # Used only in weighted_roundrobin strategy
      balance:
          strategy:
              "weighted_roundrobin" # Load balancing algorithm:
              # "roundrobin" (default), "weighted_roundrobin",
              # "random", or "response_aware"
      http_client:
          agent: "LLMProxy/1.0" # [Optional] Custom User-Agent (default: "LLMProxy/1.0")
          keepalive: 60 # [Optional] TCP keepalive in seconds (0-600, 0=disabled)
          stream: true # [Optional] Enable streaming support (default: true)
          timeout:
              connect: 10 # Connection timeout in seconds (default: 10)
              request: 300 # Request timeout in seconds (default: 300)
              idle: 60 # Idle connection timeout in seconds (default: 60)
          retry:
              enabled: true # Enable request retries (default: false)
              attempts: 3 # Maximum retry attempts
              initial: 500 # Initial retry delay in milliseconds
          proxy:
              enabled: false # Use outbound proxy (default: false)
              url: "http://user:pass@proxy:8080" # Proxy server URL with optional auth
```

### Configuration Best Practices

1. **Security Hardening**:

    - In production environments, implement secure storage solutions for sensitive API credentials
    - Leverage environment variables or dedicated key management services (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.) for credential handling
    - Restrict admin interface access by binding to localhost (`127.0.0.1`) and implementing appropriate authentication

2. **Performance Optimization**:

    - Fine-tune timeout parameters based on the specific characteristics of each LLM provider
    - For streaming-capable LLM services, ensure `stream: true` is enabled to optimize response handling
    - Configure appropriate rate limits that balance system protection with service capacity

3. **Reliability Engineering**:
    - Enable intelligent retry mechanisms for idempotent operations to maximize success rates
    - Implement weighted load balancing to prioritize more reliable or higher-capacity providers
    - Configure redundant service providers in each upstream group for automatic failover capability
    - Set appropriate circuit breaker thresholds tailored to each upstream service's stability profile
    - Configure recovery periods based on observed service restoration patterns
    - Implement proactive monitoring of circuit breaker metrics to identify recurring stability issues
    - Utilize response time aware load balancing for high-latency applications like LLM interactions
    - Leverage the response time aware algorithm to automatically optimize traffic distribution based on real-time performance metrics

For comprehensive documentation of all available configuration options, refer to the `config.default.yaml` file included with the LLMProxy project.

## Deployment Guide

LLMProxy supports multiple deployment methodologies, including containerized Docker deployments, Kubernetes orchestration, and traditional Linux system services. Detailed instructions for each approach are provided below:

### Docker Deployment

Docker Compose provides a streamlined approach to deploying LLMProxy. Complete configuration examples are available in the project's `examples/config` directory.

1. **Prepare Configuration**:

    Place your customized `config.yaml` file in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yaml` file.

2. **Launch Services**:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

3. **Monitor Logs**:

    ```bash
    docker-compose logs -f
    ```

4. **Terminate Services**:

    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```

Docker Compose Configuration Example:

```yaml
version: "3"

services:
    llmproxy:
        image: shengyanli1982/llmproxy:latest
        container_name: llmproxy
        restart: unless-stopped
        ports:
            # Forwarding service port mappings
            - "3000:3000" # to_mixgroup
            - "3001:3001" # openai_group
            # Admin interface port mapping
            - "9000:9000" # admin
        volumes:
            - ./config.yaml:/app/config.yaml:ro
        command: ["--config", "/app/config.yaml"]
        environment:
            - TZ=UTC
        networks:
            - llmproxy-network

networks:
    llmproxy-network:
        driver: bridge
```

### Kubernetes Deployment

For Kubernetes environments, complete deployment manifests are provided in the `examples/config/kubernetes` directory.

1. **Create Resources**:

    ```bash
    # Set API key environment variables for configuration rendering
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
    export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_anthropic_api_key"

    # Navigate to Kubernetes configuration directory
    cd examples/config/kubernetes

    # Apply resources in sequence
    kubectl apply -f namespace.yaml
    kubectl apply -f configmap.yaml
    kubectl apply -f service.yaml
    kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
    ```

2. **Verify Deployment**:

    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -n llmproxy
    kubectl get services -n llmproxy
    ```

3. **Access Services**:

    Internal cluster access (using DNS service discovery):

    ```
    http://llmproxy.llmproxy.svc.cluster.local:3000
    ```

    External access (via Ingress or port forwarding):

    ```bash
    kubectl port-forward svc/llmproxy -n llmproxy 3000:3000 3001:3001 9000:9000
    ```

### Linux System Service

For traditional Linux environments, standard systemd service configurations are provided.

1. **Install Binary**:

    ```bash
    # Download latest release
    curl -L -o llmproxyd.zip https://github.com/shengyanli1982/llmproxy/releases/latest/download/llmproxyd-Linux-x64-<version>.zip

    # Extract package
    unzip llmproxyd.zip

    # Set executable permissions
    chmod +x llmproxyd

    # Install to system directory
    sudo mkdir -p /opt/llmproxy
    sudo mv llmproxyd /opt/llmproxy/
    ```

2. **Configure Service**:

    ```bash
    sudo mkdir -p /opt/llmproxy
    sudo nano /opt/llmproxy/config.yaml
    # Insert your configuration
    ```

3. **Create Service Account**:

    ```bash
    sudo useradd -r -s /bin/false llmproxy
    sudo chown -R llmproxy:llmproxy /opt/llmproxy
    ```

4. **Install Service Definition**:

    ```bash
    sudo cp examples/config/llmproxy.service /etc/systemd/system/
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    ```

5. **Enable and Start Service**:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start llmproxy
    sudo systemctl enable llmproxy
    ```

6. **Verify Operation**:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status llmproxy
    ```

### Security Best Practices

Regardless of deployment methodology, implement these security controls:

1. **Credential Protection**:

    - Never hardcode API keys directly in configuration files
    - Utilize environment variables, secrets management solutions, or Kubernetes Secrets
    - Implement regular credential rotation policies

2. **Network Security**:

    - Restrict admin interface access (port 9000) to trusted networks only
    - Consider implementing a reverse proxy (Nginx, Traefik) with TLS termination and authentication
    - Apply network segmentation to isolate components with different security requirements

3. **Least Privilege Principle**:

    - Run services with dedicated non-privileged accounts
    - Apply strict filesystem access controls
    - Implement container security best practices including non-root execution and read-only filesystems

4. **Operational Monitoring**:
    - Implement centralized logging with structured analysis capabilities
    - Configure alerting based on Prometheus metrics
    - Deploy anomaly detection to identify potential security incidents or performance degradation
